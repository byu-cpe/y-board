## What are Variables?

Variables are a way for us to store information in our program that we can change later. There are three parts to a variable: a **type**, a **name**, and a **value**. For example, I could store a variable in my program called "myFavoriteNumber" like this:

```c
int myFavoriteNumber = 8;
```

After I have _declared_ `myFavoriteNumber`, I can use it anywhere in my program. And if my favorite number changes later, I can change my variable to reflect that:

```c
myFavoriteNumber = 21;
```

<summary markdown="span">About Variable Types
</summary>

Notice that I only have to tell the _compiler_ what type of variable myFavoriteNumber is when I first declare it. If I change the value later, I don't have to include the type; the _compiler_ will remember it automatically. `myFavoriteNumber` is an `int` type variable, which means that it can only be a whole number. If my favorite number was 3.14, this type wouldn't work! Some other common variable types include `double` (for decimal numbers), `bool` (for `true` or `false` values), and `char` (for single characters like the letter `'a'`).

## Examples

Let's add a few variables to our code. In your `variables_activity.cpp` file, in the `variables_exploration` function definition, add the following lines of code:

```c
int currentLed = 1;
int currentNote = NOTE_C4;
int duration = 1000;
```

</summary>

Hopefully it's obvious what our variables represent based on their names. Notice that we can set our variables equal to other variables! `currentNote` has the same value as `NOTE_C4`. If we add `speaker_play_note(currentNote, duration)` to our code, it's the same as adding `speaker_play_note(NOTE_C4, 1000)`. Middle C will be played for one second.

We've now made three variables. Let's use them to do something interesting. First, let's light up our current LED. Add the following to your code, and upload it to your board:

```cpp
Yboard.set_led_color(currentLed, 255, 0, 0);
currentLed++;
Yboard.set_led_color(currentLed, 255, 0, 0);
currentLed++;
Yboard.set_led_color(currentLed, 255, 0, 0);
currentLed++;
Yboard.set_led_color(currentLed, 255, 0, 0);
```

</summary>

As you probably guessed by the lights on your board turning on, adding `++` to our variable name (with a semicolon at the end) increments the number our variable represents by 1. This is exactly the same as if we had written `currentLed = currentLed + 1`. It's nice that we don't have to hard-code the LED numbers into our code to tell the _compiler_ that we want to light them up. It makes our code a little easier to read.

## Exploration
<details markdown="block">
<summary markdown="span">Remember to change `main.cpp` before continuing...
</summary>
> üìù **_NOTE:_** You will need to go to `main.cpp` and change the comments to call the correct activity function:
```c
// sound_activity();
variables_activity();
```
</details>

1. Divide `currentNote` by 2 using the following code snippet: `currentNote = currentNote / 2;` Play a sound again. How does our new sound compare to our old one?

1. See what happens if you multiply or divide `currentNote` by powers of 2 (2, 4, 8, 16) and use it to play a sound. For example, how does the sound compare to our old ones if we write `currentNote = currentNote * 8;`?
    <details markdown="block">
    <summary markdown="span">Hint
    </summary>
    
    When we divide and multiply the frequency of notes by powers of 2, we get "octaves". For Middle C, this means we get higher or lower C notes.
    </details>

1. Light up three additional LEDs in the same way we did above.

## Challenges


<details markdown="block">
<summary markdown="span">Remember to comment/uncomment the correct function calls...
</summary>
_Remember to comment out the `variables_exploration();` call in the `variables_activity` function and uncomment the correct challenge function:_

```c
variables_exploration();
// variables_challenge1();
// variables_challenge2();
```
</details>

**Challenge 1:** Light up all the LEDs on the board using the pattern above, then turn them all off again.

<details markdown="block">
<summary markdown="span">Hint
</summary>

We can use `currentNote--;` to decrement our variable by 1. This is the same as writing `currentNote = currentNote - 1;`
</details>

**Challenge 2:** Use the `currentNote` and `duration` variables to play notes with random sound lengths and frequencies


<details markdown="block">
<summary markdown="span">Hint
</summary>

You can use any mathematical expression you like and set your variable equal to it. For example: `duration = ((8 * 7) / 3) * 10;` or `currentNote = 2 * 2 * 2 + 1034;`
</details>

IMPORTANT: For your `variables_challenge1` and `variables_challenge2` functions, you will need to redeclare your variables. Variables live inside functions. If we are in a new function, the variable doesn't exist any more. Can you think of any other variables you might want to make?
