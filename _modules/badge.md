<summary markdown="span">The Knob on the Y-Badge
</summary>

The knob is a device known as a **potentiometer**. We send a _voltage_ through it and measure how much of that voltage is allowed to pass through, based on the position of the knob. This allows us to return a value based on the current position of the knob using the `knob_get()` function.

## Functions

We can use the value returned from the `Yboard.get_knob()` function to change the brightness of the LEDs on our board. This is the code:

```cpp
while(true) {
    int brightness = Yboard.get_knob();
    Yboard.set_led_brightness(brightness);

    // then use Yboard.set_led_color() as normal inside this loop.
}
```

## Design Your Own Y-Badge

Now it's your turn to customize your badge. Write code to make it your own. You could make it into a three-key piano, display a spectacular light show, or anything else. The possibilities are endless! Just be sure to put all the skills you've learned to good use!

```c
// conditionals_activity();
badge_activity();
```
